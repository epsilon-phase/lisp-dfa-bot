### _Violet White <violet.white.dammit@protonmail.com>_

Generate text in a vaguely tracery like way. Generates 'efficient' compiled
code(probably somewhat large).

Takes input as an s-expression, but it might be possible to build a
converter from other syntaxes, assuming a relatively similar feature-set.
